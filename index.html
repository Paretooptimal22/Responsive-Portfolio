    <p>Hello World!!! My name is Kevin and I am an aspiring developer! I've worked in Aerospace, ESL (English Teacher), Financial Services, and currently Automotive.  I recently finished my MBA at UC Irvine and I am currently learning to become a Full Stack Developer so that I can one day rule the world! J/K...but not really.
    </p>

    <p>I enjoy traveling and learning about differnt cultures.  So far I have been to the following countries: Philippines, Hong Kong (twice), Japan, Costa Rica, and Spain.  Not sure what will be next on my list, but traveling is an expensive hobby.  Just another motivatiing factor for me to become a successful developer!</p>
